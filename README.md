# Spam-Checker-Logistic-Regression

## Overview
This project is a **Spam Filter Application** developed using **Logistic Regression** to classify messages as either **spam** or **non-spam**. It features a user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**, enabling users to easily input messages and receive instant classification results.

## Features
- **Spam Classification**:
  - Uses Logistic Regression for accurate spam detection.
  - Classifies messages as "Spam" or "Non-Spam" based on their content.

- **Interactive User Interface**:
  - Developed with Streamlit for simplicity and ease of use.
  - Allows users to input messages directly into the application for real-time analysis.

- **Efficient Model**:
  - Trained on a labeled dataset of messages.
  - Optimized for speed and accuracy in classification.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Logistic Regression (implemented using `scikit-learn`).
- **Frontend Framework**:
  - Streamlit for creating the web application interface.
- **Programming Language**:
  - Python for both backend and frontend development.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning.
  - `streamlit` for the UI.
